ExPerceive
------------------

ExPerceive analyses and visualizes Expense Data.
Pandas and Matplotlib used. 

This project started as a necessity of keeping track of monthly expenditure and to curb over-spending. 
Hence my monthly expenses sheet serves as data to this project.
I have introduced certain categories as another column in the CSV sheet in order to make tracking easier. 

Visuals
---------------
Viz1: Expenditure by each category:
